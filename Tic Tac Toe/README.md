<h3>How to Play</h3>

  The board consists of 3 rows: 'top', 'mid', and 'bot', and 3 columns: 'left', 'middle', and 'right'.
  Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column they wish to place their mark in (e.g., 'top left').
  Player 'X' starts the game, followed by player 'O'.
  The game will check for a winner after each move, and announce the winner if found, otherwise the game ends with a draw.
